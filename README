Synthetic Texas 2000-bus power system model.

This is an entirely synthetic 2000 bus case, geographically situated
in the US state of Texas. The case is designed with a 500, 230, 161
and 115 kV transmission network to serve a load that roughly mimics
the actual population of its geographic footprint. The synthetic
transmission system was designed by algorithms described in [1] to be
statistically similar to actual transmission system models but without
modeling any actual lines.

This is a synthetic power system model that does not represent the
actual grid. It was developed as part of the US ARPA-E GRID DATA
research project and contains no CEII.
